## Technical Due Diligence – Q&A Format

---

### Q1: Is this a website or a system?

This is a system.

The website is only the visible interface.
Core value lies in:
- evidence routing
- compliance logic
- predictability enforcement

---

### Q2: Why no traditional CMS or SPA framework?

Because:
- CMS increases attack surface
- SPA increases failure modes under weak networks

Procurement environments favor:
- static reliability
- explainable rendering
- zero build dependency

---

### Q3: How does the system scale?

By **node expansion**, not page duplication.

New markets = new clusters  
New products = new passports  
New regulations = new patches

No core rewrite required.

---

### Q4: How is compliance handled?

Compliance is not documented.
It is **embedded**.

Each Technical Passport:
- binds HS code
- binds standard (ISO / BIFMA / CBAM)
- binds logistics & tax logic

---

### Q5: Where is business logic stored?

- Frontend: presentation only
- Backend (/api): intelligence + task execution
- No duplication across layers

---

### Q6: What is the technical moat?

- Deterministic architecture
- Evidence-driven routing
- Audit-friendly structure

This system is easy to use,
but expensive to replicate.

---

### CTO Verdict

This is not a growth hack.

This is infrastructure.
